    <description>Analyze the network traffic captured to determine what type of network probe is being attempted by the attacker.</description>
    <tutorial>&lt;p&gt;As a Network Administrator for your company you start your normal day by logging in to your machine in the morning at 7:30am. As soon as you login you see a message containing the following information:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;"Potential Network Probe Detected by IP 97.79.245.16"&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Your company owns one public Class C:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;212.15.61.0/24&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;All traffic addressed to that Class C range of IP's are sent to the 212.15.61.194 router from your ISP.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Only 212.15.61.194 in the Class C is up right now.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Analyze the network probe being attempted and answer the questions below.&lt;/p&gt;</tutorial>
